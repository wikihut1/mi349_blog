            <h3>The Problem With Computer Science Exams</h3>

                    The applications of a computer science degree are many, but a majority of students aspire to become a software engineer. It would then stand to reason that a computer science exam would test students on their ability to perform that role to some degree. The problem with multiple choice computer science exams is that they do not test students on their programming ability. The problem is that multiple choice exams simply test students on their ability to memorize edge cases for each program rather than apply their knowledge to solving problems. The daily tasks of a software engineer involve receiving a problem and then researching the best ways to resolve that problem. Occasionally an engineer may already know the solution but it often involves googling and referencing documentation. Memorization of edge cases provides almost no benefit to a software engineer other than debugging code. So why do universities insist on testing students with endless multiple choice question exams? The answer is simple: logistics and accreditation. It would be nearly impossible to test students on a coding problem and provide them access to the internet while maintaining the integrity of the exam. I believe there is no good solution to this problem.

            <h3>My Athletic Career</h3>

                    My athletic career has been long and eventful. Starting as early as I can remember, I was always playing some kind of sport. Soccer and baseball were the first two I played. I was terrible at baseball and did not play for long. I began rowing at the end of middle school. During rowing I won multiple state championships and competed in Canadian Nationals as well as the Midwest championships where I came in third place. In addition to rowing I also wrestled. I was only able to wrestle for one season because I broke my back and was unable to take the mat again. Although I only wrestled for a short time, I won my SEC tournament and had an 11-3 record. After high school I did not participate in any sports for some time. I began competing in powerlifting during my junior year at MSU. Quickly I fell in love with the sport. After one year of training I was able to deadlift 550 lbs, squat 420 lbs, and bench 275 lbs. Although I was not able to podium at the state championships, I am confident that given another year of training I will be able to compete with other top-level powerlifters.
